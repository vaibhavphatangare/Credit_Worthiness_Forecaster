# Credit_Worthiness_Forecaster

Currently, lenders face challenges in effectively predicting which individuals are at higher risk of defaulting on their loans. Inaccurate predictions can lead to significant financial losses, either by extending credit to high-risk individuals or by denying credit to individuals who are actually creditworthy. So our project consists of machine-learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual defaulting on a loan based on their historical loan repayment behavior and transactional activities.The highest accuracy achieved is 89% with the XGBoost model. The project is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input loan details and receive real-time predictions. Additionally, data visualization is performed using Tableau and Power BI, creating reports and dashboards that provide valuableÂ insights.
